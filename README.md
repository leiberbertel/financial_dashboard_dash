# Interactive financial dashboard

### This application has the ability to configure data visualization using Plotly Dash in Python with a deep focus on data loading, filtering and visualization.
> Use the i18n module, which allows the internationalization of the content; translate the content to a specific language according to the file you save in the /locale folder with your translation. Preferably the file should have the extension .yml

## Install dependencies on your machine
We move to the `environment` folder and there we execute the following command

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the application

Execute the following commands and open the web address of the local host chosen by Dash.


```shell
python ./main.py
```

An example of the expected terminal messages is shown below:

```shell
Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/
